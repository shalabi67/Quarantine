While these people under quarantine they will be provided with all there necessities.

## Solution one: Time frieze
For M quarantine days we assume that quarantine time(M days) is just an eye blink for the people under quarantine. 
This means thea will pay no bills and they will not gain any money. It is like these M days under quarantine did not occur.
To achieve that we need to provide people under quarantine with all necessity they need like water, food, electricity, health care and etc.
